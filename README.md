# Ethertrust

Ethertrust is an organization that advocates for transparency and trustworthiness in the Ethereum ecosystem. We are building a machine learning backed, wallet reputation system for the Ethereum blockchain, where we analyze millions of transactions and their associated wallet addresses for fraud detection, pattern anomalies, and more.

We aim to use the power of public data to provide useful insights on the state of the blockchain.

## Why Ethertrust?

Financial systems have extensive fraud and anomaly detection engines that are able to track users' behaviors and transactions in a way that differentiates between human and robot. Uncommon spending behavior and drastic pattern changes areonly some of the ways that allow time series models to quantify the trustworthiness of a user, and with blockchain technology, we have access to an entire history of every single transaction that has been processed.

Ethertrust aims to use publicly available transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain to provide insights on common patterns in the community.

## How Does it Work?

By scraping publicly accessible data such as Etherscan.io's website, we are able to expand upon commonly used anomaly detection models and train our system on every transaction that has occured on the blockchain.

## In Development

Ethertrust's tools are currently in development. If you'd be interested in contributing please get in touch with me!
