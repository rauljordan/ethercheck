# Ethercheck

Machine learning backed, wallet reputation for the Ethereum blockchain.

## Why Ethercheck?

Financial systems have extensive fraud and anomaly detection engines that are able to track users' behaviors and transactions in a way that differentiates between human and robot. Uncommon spending behavior and drastic pattern changes areonly some of the ways that allow time series models to quantify the trustworthiness of a user, and with blockchain technology, we have access to an entire history of every single transaction that has been processed.

Ethercheck aims to provide a simple, smart contract that anyone can call to analyze the trustworthiness of an Ethereum wallet by providing its address.

## How Does it Work?

By mining publicly accessible data such as Etherscan.io's website, we are able to expand upon commonly used anomaly detection models and train our system on every transaction that has occured on the blockchain to provide a service that checks wallet reputation quickly and easily.

## In Development

Ethercheck is currently in development. If you'd be interested in contributing please get in touch with me!
